WIP Well documented reliable redis-backed queue library.

toc::[]

== Design priorities

In descending order of importance:

. Documentation. While the API is designed to be intuitive, everything from usage to  edge cases is documented.
. Stability. This implements a __reliable queue__. Messages are atomically moved from lists and timed-out messages are periodically reinserted up to a specified number of retries. No message should ever get lost.
. Simplicity. Functionality is kept only as complex as a single developer can comprehend at a time.

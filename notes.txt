	too complex

	does not handle failures

http://redis.io/topics/notifications
	expired notifications cannot be used because we have no guarantee the message will be handled

two lists, QUEUE and PROCESSING, hashmap of inverted timeouts
enqueue: lpush to QUEUE
processing: rpoplpush QUEUE to PROCESSING, insert key to hashmap with TTL of timeout
retry: foreach item in processing that does NOT have hash in hashmap, atomically move to QUEUE with decreased retry count


problem: guarantee items are never lost AND never processed twice: this is probably not solvable
